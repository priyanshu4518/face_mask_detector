# face_mask_detector
This project is a Face Mask Detector built using the VGG16 model and trained on a dataset imported from Kaggle. It aims to identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time.  


## introduction
The Face Mask Detector uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture to classify images of people into two categories: with mask and without mask. This project can be used in various public places to ensure safety and compliance with health guidelines.

## features
Real-time face mask detection
High accuracy with a well-trained VGG16 model
Easy to use and deploy

## dataset
The model is trained on a dataset imported from Kaggle, which contains images of people with and without masks. The dataset is preprocessed and used to train the VGG16 model to achieve high accuracy.

## results
The trained model is tested on images obtained from Google, and the results are displayed in the notebook. The model shows high accuracy in detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not
